# C++ Primer
Contains simple scripts from tutorials and exercises to help learn the C++ programming language. The examples are configured to compile with a makefile.

## Bookstore Example (currently Hello World script)
I still haven't put the bookstore item indexing example. The current code is just a hello world script. It compiles with a makefile but feel free to use launch.json if it makes your life easier. To compile and run, in your terminal (CMD or inside VS Code), use the following:

1/ Run in the terminal `make ./bookstore`
This creates the binaries associated with your bookstore program that you can later run.

2/ Run in the terminal `./bookstore`
This runs the executable. In the current case, the bookstore program will just output `Hello World` in the terminal.

3/ Run in the terminal `make clean`
This removes the binaries from the working directory.
